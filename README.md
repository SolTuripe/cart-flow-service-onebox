# E-Commerce Cart Flow Service 

## Description üõí

This project is a backend service designed for managing shopping carts within an e-commerce platform. The service includes functionalities such as creating carts (with automatic ID generation), deleting carts manually, adding and editing items within a cart, retrieving detailed cart information via GET requests, and automatically removing inactive carts after 10 minutes.

The application follows a hexagonal architecture, reflected in a well-organized folder structure:

- **Infra**: contains controllers and repositories.
- **Application**: includes request and response as well as the use case implementations.
- **Domain**: contains business logic, such as error handling, domain models, and the storage interface.

## Tech Stack & Tools üíª

- **Java 17**: Make sure your system is equipped with Java 17 to run the application.
- **Maven**: The project relies on Maven for building and managing dependencies.
- **Postman**:  Used to test and interact with the API endpoints.
